*****IMPORTANT*****
This game is made for two people to play from the same screen at the same time.
The players do not show up on the bases in the GUI but the game works.
You start from the StartMenu class the game opens to a start menu where you will give your name, choose a color, and answer a question that will determine your luck.
On pressing start from the Start Menu the scene changes to the baseball diamond.
To start a turn you press start pitch, on pressing start pitch another scene pops up with sliders.
Set the sliders where you want them, then press done. 
From there your numbers from the slider are taken into account along with the question you answered and the numbers dictate if the batter hits the ball or not.
The information on the strike count, the out count and a couple other details are shown each turn on the console or terminal.
When the rounds and scores change the numbers on the GUI that corrispond change as well.
When you go over 5 rounds the game goes to a end game screne.
The winner is displayed on the end game screne and you have the option to start over or to end the game.
